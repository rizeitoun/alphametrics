# Alphametrics Solver in Python
#### This is a binary search tree exercise from the Python track of exercism.io.  Goal was to make a python script to efficiently store and retrieve sorted data using a binary tree format to avoid array limitations.  

#### Implementation code is in alphametrics.py
#### Example tests from exercism where showing input and output as first and second parameters into assertEqual.
